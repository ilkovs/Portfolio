        <p>Hey guys ! Thank you for visiting my Portfolio website. It's a real pleasure and a challenge to be able to create
            a website from scratch.</p>
        <p>
            <i>A little bit more about me:</i>
        </p>
        <p>I'm 27 years old, originally from Bulgaria, moved to the States to be with my wife Andrea. I love travelling and
            spending time with my family.
        </p>
        <p>Web Development has always been a passion! My enrollment in Georgia Institute of Technology Coding Boot Camp is the
            best investment I have ever made in my life. I was able to meet so many talanted people, who share the same mission
            in life - to become Web Developers.</p>
        <p>For the last couple of months programming has become huge part of my life, being able to code in a professional environment,
            where I'll have the opportunity to learn, contribute for the team and build web applications at the same time
            is my ultimate goal.</p>
        <p>Feel free to download my Resume and go through my Projects in the Portfolio Section! I'll be happy to hear from you !</p>
